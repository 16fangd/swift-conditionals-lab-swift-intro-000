# Math, Booleans & Conditionals LAB


## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Test their knowledge with the following:
	* [math](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/swift-math-readme)
	* [booleans](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/swift-booleans-readme)
	* [conditionals](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/swift-conditionals-readme)
	* [functions](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/swift-functionReturn-readme)
	



## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int, Double and Bool type.
* Just learned about Bool prior to this reading.
* Just coming off a readme where they learned about `if` and `else` clauses.


## Outline / Notes

*  I've included a playground file which structures this lab in the format I want it to look like. I want the student to be challenged to think about how they can satisfy what the question is asking without too much hand holding.
